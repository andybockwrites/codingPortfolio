      <p class='text-center'>
        I am a new web developer that just completed a full stack coding boot camp with the University of Central Florida.

      <p class='text-center'>
        I earned my bachelor's degree in English/Creative Writing in 2012, but after years of freelance writing I decided to pivot and expand my skillset.

        I was born and raised in Vero Beach, FL before I attended the University of Central Florida. After graduating, I worked for Disney World for a couple of years until my writing career led me to move to Nashville, TN. I lived there for six years, working in the business side of the music industry by day and as a freelance writer by night, writing the scripts to over 40 radio commercials.

        In my free time, I love to watch movies and television, I'm a big gamer, I love baseball, and I play guitar and write music that is never, ever released (for the best).
